	This programme is to demonstrate how binary search is way faster than using a for loop to find an item in a 
	given List / Array, Binary Search is faster with a time complexity of O(log n) â¬… (in Worst Case Scenario's)  
	wheras time complexity of for loop is O(n) â¬… (In mostly all Scenario's).

	How a Binary Search works:
		A binary serch begins to work by sorting a list, After doing so it checks if the item in the mddle of the list
		is the target to search for, if so it returns the target, of not it checks if it is greater than or less than 
		the target, and if it is lesser, it selects the portion of list on the right, and vice versa if its greater.
		It proceeds to the while loop (You could also use recursion...) and iterates through the proccess, till the 
		list narrows down to the target.
